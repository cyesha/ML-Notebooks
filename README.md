# ML-Notebooks
Description: Collection of my graduate school machine learning activities, exercises, and homework solutions in Jupyter notebooks/Google Colab (ipynb files). This repository serves as a showcase of my learning progress and practical experience in various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and applications throughout my academic journey.

| Algorithm | Dataset | Link | Remarks |
